# Bursts and beats

A lab rotation with the [Benda lab](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/biologie/institute/neurobiologie/lehrbereiche/neuroethology/) where we tried to record intracellularly from neurons in the ELL of black ghost knifefish that encode chirps, a common communication signal in the electric domain. We only managed to record stabily from a neuron that responded to certain beat frequencies, so we analysed the type of neuron we recorded from and how its spike bursts contribute to the information it can convey about a given stimulus.

This lab rotation was summarized in a protocol that you can view [here](protocol/main.pdf).
